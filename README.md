Band Structure Plot of Monolayer Graphene and Twisted Bilayer Graphene based on [PRB,Â 103(20), 205411 B. A. Bernevig (2021)].
Here I developed Hexagonal and Tripod Model which are the equivalent TBG Continuum model(BM model) with different Center Position.
For the Hexagonal Model, the center is at Moire Gamma point, while for the Tripod Model, the center is at Moire K point.
